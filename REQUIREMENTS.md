# Requirements 

## Software

The main software requirement to use this artefact is Docker. The artefact is
installed and run via Docker CLI commands. 

Alternatively Podman could be used using the equivalent commands (although the
`run-benchmarks` script only works with Docker).

A PDF viewer is also required to view the table of results produced by the
artefact.

## Storage

The Granule image is ~4GB once loaded so we recommend having at least 4.5GB
available storage capacity.
