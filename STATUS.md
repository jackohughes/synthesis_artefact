# Status

With this artefact we are applying for both Functional and Reusable badges. We
give our justification for each below:
- ***Functional***: Our artefact can reproduce our table of results from the paper 
  in a few simple commands. We provide a step-by-step guide on how to do so, 
  as well as a script which automates this process.
- ***Reusable***: As well as reproducing our results from the paper, we also provide
  numerous ways in which the reviewer can configure the benchmarking tool to
  produce a variety of outputs. Furthermore, we provide the means to optionally
  analyse the output of the tool beyond the generated table. Guides and
  documentation to do both are provided, along with several examples.
